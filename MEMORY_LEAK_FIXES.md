# Memory Leak Fixes - FluxStack Live Components

## ✅ Summary of Critical Fixes Applied

### 🚨 **Problem 1: Temporary Instance Creation Leak**
**Location**: `core/live/LiveAction.ts:36-42`

**Issue**: During component registration (`LiveAction.add()`), temporary instances were created and never released, causing memory leaks.

**Solution**: Changed from persistent temporary instance to factory function that creates and immediately discards instances:

```typescript
// BEFORE (Memory Leak):
const tempInstance: LiveAction = new actionClass()
const getClientInitialState = (props: any) => {
    return tempInstance.getInitialState(props || {}) // tempInstance never released
}

// AFTER (Fixed):
const getClientInitialState = (props: any) => {
    const tempInstance: LiveAction = new actionClass()
    const state = tempInstance.getInitialState(props || {})
    // Instance automatically garbage collected after return
    return state
}
```

### 🚨 **Problem 2: Persistent Instance Accumulation**
**Location**: `core/live/LiveAction.ts:76-96` + `core/server/plugins/live.ts:19-23`

**Issue**: Live instances were stored indefinitely without cleanup when clients disconnected.

**Solution**: Implemented client-component tracking with automatic cleanup:

```typescript
// New tracking system
private static clientComponentMap = new Map<string, Set<string>>()

// Register component ownership
public static registerClientComponent(clientId: string, componentId: string)

// Clean all components when client disconnects
public static cleanupClient(clientId: string)
```

**WebSocket Integration**:
```typescript
close: (ws: any) => {
    console.log(`❌ Live client disconnected: ${ws.id}`)
    LiveAction.cleanupClient(ws.id) // Auto cleanup
}
```

### 🚨 **Problem 3: Hydration Session Accumulation**
**Location**: `core/live/HydrationManager.ts:21-33` + `213-226`

**Issue**: Hydration sessions accumulated indefinitely with infrequent cleanup.

**Solution**: Implemented aggressive cleanup strategy:

- **Reduced session max age**: 1 hour → 30 minutes
- **More frequent cleanup**: 10 minutes → 5 minutes
- **Additional cleanup**: Every 1 minute for failed sessions
- **New cleanup method**: `cleanupFailedSessions()` for sessions with max attempts exceeded

---

### 🚨 **Problem 4: Lack of Memory Monitoring**
**Location**: `app/server/routes/memory.ts`

**Issue**: No visibility into memory usage in production.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive monitoring endpoints:

#### **GET /api/memory/stats**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-13T00:25:56.204Z",
  "liveAction": {
    "registrySize": 13,
    "instanceCount": 0,
    "clientStateRegistrySize": 13,
    "clientComponentMapSize": 0,
    "activeClients": [],
    "componentsPerClient": {}
  },
  "hydration": {
    "totalSessions": 0,
    "activeComponents": [],
    "oldestSession": null,
    "newestSession": null
  },
  "nodeMemory": {
    "rss": "245 MB",
    "heapTotal": "5 MB", 
    "heapUsed": "5 MB",
    "external": "1 MB"
  },
  "analysis": {
    "memoryPressure": "LOW",
    "hydrationPressure": "LOW",
    "recommendations": ["Memory usage looks healthy"]
  }
}
```

#### **GET /api/memory/health**
Health check with thresholds:
- Max instances: 200
- Max sessions: 300
- Max heap: 500MB

#### **POST /api/memory/cleanup**
Manual cleanup trigger for emergency situations.

## 🎯 Validation

### Test Results:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/memory/stats
# Returns healthy stats with 0 instances when no clients connected
```

### Log Evidence:
```
❌ Live client disconnected: 21975c1ac25894f3
🗑️  Destroyed persistent instance for test-counter-fixed
🧹 Cleaned up 1 components for disconnected client 21975c1ac25894f3
```
